function askUser() {
   inquirer.prompt([
     {
       Here you can ask what they would like to do and in this would be an option for not adding anymore
       choices: [
         "Engineer",
         "Intern",
         "I don't want to add any more team members"
       ]
     }
   ]).then(_userChoice_ => {
     switch (userChoice.memberChoice) {
       case "Engineer":
         addEngineer();
         break;
       case "Intern":
         addIntern();
         break;
       default:
         buildTeam();

   });

That is an example - so you would basically start out (like how you did basic questions) to get them started and say hey what would you like to do- then based on their choice you would continue ( engineer, intern, or stop if they chose they didn't want to add anymore)
10:55
So add in another option to your basic questions one- if that makes sense
10:55
And add in another switch statement

so this would go right after the switch statement that i have written, correct?

As far as I understand you want it to be another switch statement
10:58
Bc you're asking the user what do you want to do? Create an intern, a manager, an engineer or stop
10:59
Or create a whole different function that only asks one question in the inquirier prompt ("what would you like to do- create more or not) then have another switch statement like above
10:59
That function would then be called at the end of each function where you want to trigger it

Andy Pedonti  10:59 PM
if it i would start that extra switch statement at line 112 on my code i think that i do understand

In this case- in the addManager, addIntern and add Engineer
11:00
Yes- you could all it at the completion of each function- so that it automatically asks the user
11:01
And the format would be similar to the basic questions function - except with one question and then a .then with a switch statement
